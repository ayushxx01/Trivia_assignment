**About the Project**
This project leverages two powerful Flutter packages—Hive and Provider—for efficient state management, data persistence, and app functionality.

**1. Hive**
A lightweight and fast key-value database.
Used to persist data like user preferences and game history locally on the user's device.
Enables the app to function seamlessly offline without requiring an internet connection.
Ideal for scenarios needing quick read/write operations.

**2. Provider**
A popular state management solution in Flutter.
Simplifies managing and modifying app states in response to user interactions.
Manages the app's state, including:
Game status
User settings
Other dynamic elements
Ensures real-time UI updates, keeping the app responsive and interactive.
How the App Works
User Interaction

When users answer trivia questions, the app updates the game state (e.g., score, answers) using Provider.
The UI reflects these changes in real-time, such as updating the score or displaying the next question.
Data Persistence

User data (e.g., game history, preferences, settings) is stored using Hive.
Data remains intact across sessions, allowing users to resume progress seamlessly.
Why Hive and Provider?
Combining Hive and Provider ensures:

Offline functionality by efficiently managing local data.
A responsive, interactive user experience.
A robust and scalable foundation for enhanced app performance.
